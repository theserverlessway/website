The Serverless Way is a Consulting Company founded by Florian Motlik.

With new Services getting released constantly AWS is becoming more complicated every day. Coupled with a lack of Usability in their tooling and documentation this can quickly make teams less productive than they could be.

After years as Co-Founder and CTO of [Codeship](https://codeship.com) and CTO of [Serverless Inc](https://serverless.com) I'm now helping teams to become more productive in their use of AWS. Specifically I can help you to

* Improve your processes by learning to use CloudFormation, the AWS CLI and other AWS tools effectively
* Improve your Architecture through reviews and including new services into your infrastructure
* Improve your processes by focusing on fast deployment, automated testing and clean releases
